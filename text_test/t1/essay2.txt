There are layers so dogs bark. But tiny dogs that don't really bark with power but are more annoying that is a yap. When people gossip, a metaphor is that they are yapping, they are just annoyingly talking just to talk saying anything they are non-stop and keep going.

In America a trend is that marginalized groups often turn insults into positives. So people that were insulted saying they yap too much, like an annoying little dog. Now it's almost like me and you are so close we can yap to each other and enjoy it. I love that you feel like you can yap to me, etc. So now when people get together just to talk, gossip, blab, tell stories, run their mouth, etc they might say "Yap".
